# 🏅 Sports Person Classifier

This project is an image classification model that identifies and classifies images of sports personalities into predefined categories. Given an image of a person, the model predicts which sports person it is from the trained categories.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn (SVM Classifier)

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset consists of images of various well-known sports personalities. Each category contains multiple images of a specific person. The images were used to train the model to distinguish between the categories based on visual features. All images were preprocessed using OpenCV for consistent input to the model.

## 🧠 Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Input**: Image of a person
- **Output**: Predicted category (sports person)
